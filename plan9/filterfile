# This script overrides the bash version when I'm running something
# from plan9port.
# That way I can still use the rc shell syntax with the 'filterfile' script.
# This also means that when running plan9 programs I get a slightly nicer
# syntax for this functionality.

# I want to make this script more "see-through" to the user.
# i.e. I'd like to remove the need to quote pipelines when you want to filter
# a file with a complex command.
# I don't think this is possible -- but I'm planning on keeping an eye out
# while reading about the shell, just in case.
