# Outline of what this script needs to do:
#	Get the tag we're searching for via the argument
#	Store output of grep <argument> 9tags in variable
#	If variable is one line long, 'Plumb' it
#	Otherwise, print all lines (should go to +Errors window)

# Currently the only action I still need is to know how to 'Plumb' something
# Have a look at the "plumb" command.
# Would be reasonably nice to have 'findtag' as a plumbing rule in
#  $HOME/lib/plumbing -- but it may be troublesome to find a heuristic that
#  accurately tells us whether the user wanted to search for a string via tags or
#  just in the current file.

# Have the order of arguments like this for convenience of use inside acme.

# I could use my grep_column script here, but since its main power is not
# needed I think it better to not create dependencies where they're not needed.
