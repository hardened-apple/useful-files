These are my personalisation files from home and work laptops.

There are also some scripts in the 'general' directory.

The xresources directory contains a whole load of colorschemes I've copied
from someplace or another. A lot are from copycat-killer/dots on github,
hybrid comes from a link on w0ng/vim-hybrid, multicolored comes from 'The
Immoral Pheonix' on deviantart.com
